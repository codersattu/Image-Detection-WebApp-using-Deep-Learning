# Image-Detection-WebApp-using-Deep-Learning
This project is a web application built with Flask and a deep learning model to distinguish between real images (captured by cameras) and fake images (generated using GANs). Users can upload an image, and the app will predict whether the image is real or fake, displaying the result along with a preview of the uploaded image.
